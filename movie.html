	<h1>Wormiguel's short</h1>
	<p> After a long day at work, It's nice to just stop and breath for a second. </p>

	<p> My animation "Wormiguel goes home" is a short animation that captures a moment of relief and calm. The inspiration for this project came from the overwhelming nature of young adulthood. Everything is so mundane, it often feels like we live the same day over and over again. To bring this concept to life, I used Photoshop frame-by-frame animation and Adobe after effects. Not much changed from storyboard to finished product.  I obviously found myself making adjustments and adding additional details to better convey an exhausted tone.The most challenging aspect of the project was animating the short itself. It plays at 10 frames per second, for 30 seconds, amounting to 300 individual frames.
